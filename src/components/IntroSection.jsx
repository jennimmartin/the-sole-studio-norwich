          <p>
            If you're on your feet all day, train regularly, or struggle with
            recurring foot issues, a standard beauty treatment often isn't
            enough.
          </p>
          <p>
            At The Sole Studio Norwich, every treatment is focused on how your
            feet function as well as how they look. Whether you're dealing with
            discomfort, hard skin, damaged toenails, or simply tired, overworked
            feet, treatments are tailored to what your feet actually need.
          </p>
          <p className="font-medium">
            This is professional, judgement-free foot care — without unnecessary
            clinical intervention.

          </h3>

            <p>
              The Sole Studio Norwich was created to bridge the gap between
              beauty treatments and clinical foot care.
            </p>
            <p>
              I specialise in working with people who use their feet hard —
              runners, gym-goers, professionals on their feet all day, and
              anyone dealing with ongoing foot concerns that don’t require
              podiatry. My approach combines expert technique, attention to
              detail, and genuine care, ensuring your feet feel better, function
              better, and look better.
            </p>
            <p className="font-medium">
              If a condition falls outside my scope, I’ll always advise you
              honestly and guide you toward appropriate care.
